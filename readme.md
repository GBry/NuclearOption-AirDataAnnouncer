# GPWS Altitude Callouts Mod

Tested with 0.32 (30 Jan 2026)

Copy to its own folder in Bepinex/plugins. Make a new folder (AirDataAnnouncer or something)

"Altea" soundpack is from the XR project (https://www.alteaaerospace.com/)

Pretty straightforward.

Didn't add the pull up sound because well, it would be annoying

- Mach number callouts
- Cleared to land
- Gear up/down in transit
- Gear up/down locked
- Altitude callouts
- 100 Above
