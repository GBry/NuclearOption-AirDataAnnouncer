# GPWS Altitude Callouts Mod

"Altea" soundpack is from the XR project (https://www.alteaaerospace.com/)

Pretty straightforward.

Didn't add the pull up sound because well, it would be annoying

Available modes:
- Mach number callouts
- Cleared to land
- Gear up/down in transit
- Gear up/down locked
- Altitude callouts
- 100 Above
- Minimum
- Retard
